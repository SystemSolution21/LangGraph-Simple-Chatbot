# LangGraph-Simple-Chatbot

```
A simple chatbot application built using LangGraph.

This script defines a stateful graph that manages a conversation
with a language model. It initializes a chat model, sets up a
state graph with a single chatbot node, and provides a command-line
interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
